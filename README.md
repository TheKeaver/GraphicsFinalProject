# GraphicsFinalProject
Final project submission for Computer Graphics course

This code is unlikely to function at the current time. In the future this will be fixed to work for demonstration purposes. Until then
this repository will serve to give an overview of experience with JavaScript, HTML, and 3D graphics work.

Please note that some of these resources were given to members of the class to build upon. Most, however, were made by me with guidance
of homework/lab assignments and teacher instruction.
